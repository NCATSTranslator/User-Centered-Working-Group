# Recruitment Methods <br />

Survey respondents will be recruited via three primary channels: 1) the biomedical research community at Drexel University, 2) the biomedical research community at Tufts University, and 3) the community of investigators participating in the Translator project. <br />

We will approach the Associate Dean for Research (ADR) at the Drexel University College of Computing and Informatics to facilitate communication with, and dissemination of our survey on behalf of, the other ADRs at Drexel University who are situated in the Drexel biomedical research community (e.g., the ADRs of the School of Biomedical Engineering, Science and Health Systems; College of Medicine; College of Arts and Sciences; and College of Nursing and Health Professions). We will similarly leverage our collaborative relationships to approach the analogous ADRs at Tufts University and respective points of contact (POCs) via the Translator community. <br />

Snowball sampling will be used for all recruitment channels toward maximizing survey completion. Standard e-mail communications will be used for recruitment and correspondence.

# Incentivizing Respondents

Survey participation will be incentivized by entering respondents into a raffle for the chance of winning a prize valued at approximately $1000.00.

# Expediting Survey Completion

Every two weeks after the survey has been disseminated, scheduled reminder messages will be distributed by the POCs who helped disseminate the survey, with the aim of maximizing survey completion. The following message is a potential format to use:<br />
