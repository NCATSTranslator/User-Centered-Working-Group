The Biomedical Data Translator is a program funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) targeting the following problems: 1) biomedical data and knowledge are heterogeneous, from different areas of research, often disconnected, disorganized, and mired in disparate jargon; and 2) biomedical data and knowledge are vast and represent a scale of contents beyond what humans can manage. <br />

This exploratory survey is the first step in a series of user-centered studies where the aim is to learn about the conditions that make the Biomedical Data Translator accepted and adopted by prospective users, including conducting a requirements analysis for possible features of the Biomedical Data Translator. The objective of this exploratory survey is twofold: 1) to understand how the problems described above impact prospective users, and 2) to identify individuals interested in participating in the subsequent user-centered studies. <br />

Methodological steps will include other forms of user-centered studies such as focus groups and interviews; participation is an opportunity to help shape the Biomedical Data Translator. <br />
