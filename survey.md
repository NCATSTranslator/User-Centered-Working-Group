This survey is being used to gather data on the electronic biomedical research platform, Translator. The Translator program is funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As a platform for facilitating biomedical research, the concept of Translator is analogous to a virtual oracle (i.e., all-knowing entity) that can search through and synthesize vast amounts of biomedical knowledge (e.g., Reactome, DrugBank) and biomedical data (e.g., GenBank, UniProt) to answer biomedical questions. The idea behind Translator is that biomedical researchers ask questions to help define and refine research hypotheses for more effective and efficient biomedical science. <br />

This survey is intended for biomedical researchers. Please provide an answer to each item listed below. We truly appreciate your time and perspective and offer our gratitude for your efforts. <br />
